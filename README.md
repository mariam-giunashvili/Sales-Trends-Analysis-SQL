# Sales Trends Analysis - SQL Portfolio Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales trends in the art market using SQL. The dataset includes sales data with information such as sale dates, galleries, artists, and sale prices. The analysis aims to identify trends in sales over time, highlight top-selling artists, and determine which galleries performed best.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains detailed information on art sales transactions, specifically focusing on galleries, artists, and the artworks they sold. It was sourced from a collection of records documenting sales data, providing a comprehensive view of the art market across multiple years. The data includes sales from various galleries, featuring a diverse range of artists and artworks of different sizes and origins.

***The data used for this analysis was sourced from an Excel file containing the following key columns:***

- **Sale Date**: The date of the sale.
- **Sales Year**: The year the sale occurred.
- **Sales Month**: The month the sale occurred.
- **Gallery**: The gallery where the sale was made.
- **Artist**: The name of the artist whose work was sold.
- **Origin Year**: The year the artwork was created.
- **Length (in)**: The length of the artwork (in inches).
- **Width (in)**: The width of the artwork (in inches).
- **Sale Price**: The price at which the artwork was sold.

## Key SQL Queries
***Here are SQL queries used to perform the analysis, along with their explanations:***

- ## yearly number of sales
  Query Purpose: This query calculates the total number of paintings sold in each year. By grouping the data by the Sales_Year column, it provides insights into how the number of sales fluctuated year by year.
- ```sql
   select [Sales_Year],
   count ( [Artist]) as "Quantity of Paintings"
   from [dbo].[Paintings Sales] 
   group by [Sales_Year]

- ## Monthly number of Sales in each year
  Query Purpose: This query analyzes sales trends on a monthly basis within each year. It groups the data by both Sales_Year and Sales_Month, showing how sales numbers change throughout the year.
- ```sql
        Select [Sales_Year],[Sales_Month],
        count ( [Artist]) as "Quantity of Paintings"
	from [dbo].[Paintings Sales]
	group by  [Sales_Year],[Sales_Month]


- ## the amount of time each artist's paintings were sold
  Query Purpose: This query counts the number of sales each artist has made. Grouping by the Artist column and counting Sale_Price provides a clear view of the most and least popular artists based on sales volume.
- ```sql
    SELECT  Artist, 
    COUNT([Sale_Price]) AS "Number_of_Sales"
    FROM [dbo].[Paintings Sales]
    GROUP BY [Artist]
    ORDER BY Number_of_Sales desc


- ## sales revenue genereated by galleries in each year from highest to lowest
  Query Purpose: This query calculates the total sales revenue generated by each gallery in each year. The results are ordered by revenue, showing which galleries generated the most income year over year.
- ```sql
     Select [Gallery],
     [Sales_Year],
     SUM([Sale_Price]) as "Revenue"
     from [dbo].[Paintings Sales]
     group by [Gallery], [Sales_Year]
     order by "Revenue" desc 

- ## pivot table illustrating total sales revenue each yaer aacross galleries
  Query Purpose: This query produces a pivot table that compares total sales revenue across galleries over multiple years. The pivot format helps to visualize the sales trends over the selected years (2007, 2008, etc.) across different galleries.
- ```sql
  select* from 
  (select [Gallery],
  [Sale_Price],
  [Sales_Year]
   from [dbo].[Paintings Sales])t
   pivot(
   sum ([Sale_Price])
   FOR [Sales_Year] in ([2007], [2008], [2009], [2010], [2011]) 
   ) as "pivot"

- ## Compare galleries sales to see if the revenue only depends on the number of paintings sold
  Query Purpose: This query compares the number of paintings sold by each gallery to the total revenue generated. The aim is to understand whether higher sales quantities directly lead to higher revenue, or if other factors (like higher-priced paintings) play a role.
- ```sql
   Select [Gallery],
   COUNT([Sale_Price])AS "Number_of_Sales",
   sum([Sale_Price]) as "Revenue"
   FROM [dbo].[Paintings Sales]
   GROUP BY [Gallery]
   ORDER BY Revenue DESC


- ## Revenue generated by artists
  Query Purpose: This query sums up the revenue generated by each artist, providing insight into which artists contributed the most in terms of total sales value. It helps identify top-performing artists in terms of monetary sales.
- ```sql
  select [Artist],
  sum ([Sale_Price]) as "Revenue"
  from [dbo].[Paintings Sales]
  group by [Artist]
  order by Revenue desc

- ## Top artists whose total sales exceeded 100000
 Query Purpose: This query identifies the top artists whose total sales exceeded $100,000. It groups the data by artist and filters the results to only include those whose sales have crossed the $100,000 mark, highlighting the most financially successful artists.
- ```sql
   Select [Artist], 
   sum(Sale_Price) as "Total_Sales"
   from [dbo].[Paintings Sales]
   group by [Artist]    
   having sum(Sale_Price) > '100000'


- ## determine whether the price of the painting is correlated with its size
  Query Purpose: This query determines whether the size of a painting (calculated as length × width in square inches) has any correlation with its sale price. This can help assess whether larger paintings tend to sell for more.
- ```sql   
    Select  [Sale_Price],
    CAST(Length_in AS INT) * CAST(Width_in AS INT) AS "Size_of_the_painting_sq.in"
    from [dbo].[Paintings Sales]
    order by [Sale_Price] desc 


- ## Determine if there’s a trend in sale price because of the year in which the artwork was created.
  Query Purpose: This query examines whether the year in which the artwork was created (Origin Year) affects its sale price. By grouping sales data by Orign_Year and summing up the total revenue, it seeks to reveal any patterns related to the age of the artwork and its market value.
- ```sql
    Select [Orign_Year],
    SUM([Sale_Price]) as "Total_sales_revenue
    from [dbo].[Paintings Sales]
    group by [Orign_Year]
    order by [Orign_Year]
