# Sales Trends Analysis - SQL Portfolio Project

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to analyze sales trends in the art market using SQL. The analysis shows trends in sales over time, identifies top-selling artists, determines which galleries performed best and provides some other interesting approaches 

## The Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project contains information about art sales, specifically focusing on galleries, artists, and the artworks they sold. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the art market across multiple years. The data includes sales from many different galleries, together with the information about artists and artworks of different sizes and origins.

***The data used for this analysis is from an Excel file which was imported in SQL and contains the following columns:***

- **Sale Date** - The date of the sale. 
- **Sales Year** - The year that the painting was purchased.
- **Sales Month** - The month that the painting was purchased.
- **Gallery** - The gallery where the sale took place.
- **Artist** - The name of the artist whose artwork was sold.
- **Origin Year** - The year in which the artwork was created.
- **Length (in)** - The artwork's length measured in inches.
- **Width (in)** - The artwork's width measured in inches.
- **Sale Price** - The price that was paid for the piece of art.

## SQL Queries
***Here are SQL queries used for the analysis, along with their explanations:***

- ## yearly number of sales
  **The Purpose**: This query calculates the total number of paintings sold in each year and  provides insights about how the number of sales fluctuated year by year. It groups the data by the Sales_Year column for clearly understanding the information
- ```sql
   select [Sales_Year],
   count ( [Artist]) as "Quantity of Paintings"
   from [dbo].[Paintings Sales] 
   group by [Sales_Year]

 - ## Monthly number of Sales in each year
  **The Purpose**: This query analyzes sales trends on a monthly basis in each year. It groups the data by both Sales_Year and Sales_Month, showing how sales numbers change throughout the year.
- ```sql
        Select [Sales_Year],[Sales_Month],
        count ( [Artist]) as "Quantity of Paintings"
	from [dbo].[Paintings Sales]
	group by  [Sales_Year],[Sales_Month]


- ## the amount of time each artist's paintings were sold
  **The Purpose**: This query counts the number of sales for each artist . Grouping by the Artist column and counting Sale_Price, this query provides a clear view of the most and least popular artists based on the quantity of sales
- ```sql
    SELECT  Artist, 
    COUNT([Sale_Price]) AS "Number_of_Sales"
    FROM [dbo].[Paintings Sales]
    GROUP BY [Artist]
    ORDER BY Number_of_Sales desc


- ## sales revenue genereated by galleries in each year from highest to lowest
  **The Purpose**: This query calculates the total sales revenue generated by each gallery in each year. The results are ordered by revenue, showing which galleries generated the most income year over year.
- ```sql
     Select [Gallery],
     [Sales_Year],
     SUM([Sale_Price]) as "Revenue"
     from [dbo].[Paintings Sales]
     group by [Gallery], [Sales_Year]
     order by "Revenue" desc 

- ## pivot table illustrating total sales revenue each yaer aacross galleries
  **The Purpose**: This query produces a pivot table that compares total sales revenue across galleries over the selected years (2007, 2008, etc.). 
- ```sql
  select* from 
  (select [Gallery],
  [Sale_Price],
  [Sales_Year]
   from [dbo].[Paintings Sales])t
   pivot(
   sum ([Sale_Price])
   FOR [Sales_Year] in ([2007], [2008], [2009], [2010], [2011]) 
   ) as "pivot"

- ## Compare galleries sales to see if the revenue only depends on the number of paintings sold
  **The Purpose**: This query compares the number of paintings sold by each gallery to the total revenue generated. The aims to clarify whether higher sales quantities directly lead to higher revenue.
- ```sql
   Select [Gallery],
   COUNT([Sale_Price])AS "Number_of_Sales",
   sum([Sale_Price]) as "Revenue"
   FROM [dbo].[Paintings Sales]
   GROUP BY [Gallery]
   ORDER BY Revenue DESC


- ## Revenue generated by artists
  **The Purpose**: This query sums up the revenue generated by each artist, showing the artists that contributed the most in terms of total sales value. It helps identify top-performing artists in terms of sales.
- ```sql
  select [Artist],
  sum ([Sale_Price]) as "Revenue"
  from [dbo].[Paintings Sales]
  group by [Artist]
  order by Revenue desc

- ## Top artists whose total sales exceeded 100000
  **The Purpose**: This query identifies the top artists whose total sales exceeded $100,000 by grouping the data by artist and filters the results to only include those whose sales satisfies the criteria , highlighting the most financially successful artists.
- ```sql
   Select [Artist], 
   sum(Sale_Price) as "Total_Sales"
   from [dbo].[Paintings Sales]
   group by [Artist]    
   having sum(Sale_Price) > '100000'


- ## determine whether the price of the painting is correlated with its size
  **The Purpose**: This query determines whether the size of a painting (calculated as length × width in square inches) is determinant of its sale price. This can help to understand whether larger paintings tend to be more expensive and are sold more
- ```sql   
    Select  [Sale_Price],
    CAST(Length_in AS INT) * CAST(Width_in AS INT) AS "Size_of_the_painting_sq.in"
    from [dbo].[Paintings Sales]
    order by [Sale_Price] desc 


- ## Determine if there’s a trend in sale price because of the year in which the artwork was created.
  **The Purpose**: This query examines whether the year in which the artwork was created (Origin Year) affects its price. By grouping sales data by Orign_Year and summing up the total revenue, it aims to reveal any correlation between the age of the artwork and its market value.
- ```sql
    Select [Orign_Year],
    SUM([Sale_Price]) as "Total_sales_revenue"
    from [dbo].[Paintings Sales]
    group by [Orign_Year]
    order by [Orign_Year]
