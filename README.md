# Sales Trends Analysis - SQL Portfolio Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales trends in the art market using SQL. The dataset includes sales data with information such as sale dates, galleries, artists, and sale prices. The analysis aims to identify trends in sales over time, highlight top-selling artists, and determine which galleries performed best.

## Dataset Description
The data used for this analysis was sourced from an Excel file containing the following key columns:
- **Sale Date**: The date of the sale.
- **Sales Year**: The year the sale occurred.
- **Sales Month**: The month the sale occurred.
- **Gallery**: The gallery where the sale was made.
- **Artist**: The name of the artist whose work was sold.
- **Origin Year**: The year the artwork was created.
- **Length (in)**: The length of the artwork (in inches).
- **Width (in)**: The width of the artwork (in inches).
- **Sale Price**: The price at which the artwork was sold.

## Key SQL Queries
Here are SQL queries used to perform the analysis, along with their explanations:

- ## yearly number of sales
- sql
 select [Sales_Year],
     count ( [Artist]) as "Quantity of Paintings"
	 from [dbo].[Paintings Sales] 
	 group by [Sales_Year]

- ## Monthly number of Sales in each year 
select [Sales_Year],[Sales_Month],
        count ( [Artist]) as "Quantity of Paintings"
		from [dbo].[Paintings Sales]
		group by  [Sales_Year],[Sales_Month]



--## the amount of time each artist's paintings were sold
SELECT  Artist, 
    COUNT([Sale_Price]) AS "Number_of_Sales"
FROM [dbo].[Paintings Sales]
GROUP BY [Artist]
ORDER BY Number_of_Sales desc
    

- ## sales revenue genereated by galleries in each year from highest to lowest
select [Gallery],
       [Sales_Year],
	   SUM([Sale_Price]) as "Revenue"
	   from [dbo].[Paintings Sales]
	   group by [Gallery], [Sales_Year]
	   order by "Revenue" desc 

- ## pivot table illustrating total sales revenue each yaer aacross galleries
select* from 
(select [Gallery],
       [Sale_Price],
	   [Sales_Year]
	   from [dbo].[Paintings Sales])t

pivot(

sum ([Sale_Price])
FOR [Sales_Year] in ([2007], [2008], [2009], [2010], [2011]) 
) as "pivot"

- ## Compare galleries sales to see if the revenue only depends on the number of paintings sold
 select [Gallery],
   COUNT([Sale_Price])AS "Number_of_Sales",
   sum([Sale_Price]) as "Revenue"
FROM [dbo].[Paintings Sales]
GROUP BY [Gallery]
ORDER BY Revenue DESC


- ## Revenue generated by artists
select [Artist],
      sum ([Sale_Price]) as "Revenue"
	  from [dbo].[Paintings Sales]
	  group by [Artist]
	  order by Revenue desc

- ## Top artists whose total sales exceeded 100000
SELECT Artist, 
   SUM(Sale_Price) AS "Total_Sales"
FROM [dbo].[Paintings Sales]
GROUP BY Artist    
HAVING SUM(Sale_Price) > '100000'



- ## determine whether the price of the painting is correlated with its size       
select  [Sale_Price],
        CAST(Length_in AS INT) * CAST(Width_in AS INT) AS "Size_of_the_painting_sq.in"
	 from [dbo].[Paintings Sales]
	 order by [Sale_Price] desc 


- ## Determine if thereâ€™s a trend in sale price because of the year in which the artwork was created.
select [Orign_Year],
      SUM([Sale_Price]) as "Total_sales_revenue
	   from [dbo].[Paintings Sales]
	   group by [Orign_Year]
	   order by [Orign_Year]
